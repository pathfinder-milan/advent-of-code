# 🎄 Advent of Code — My Solutions (2024 & 2025)

Welcome to my festive corner of **Advent of Code**, where I warm myself with puzzles, stories, and a questionable amount of hot chocolate.  
As always, December feels magical — not just because of Christmas, but because **Eric Wastl** gifts us 25 days of beautiful chaos wrapped in wholesomeness.  
**Thank you Eric, for making my December feel amazing every single year! ❤️**

## ✨ Years & Languages

### **📘 2024 — Python**
All my 2024 solutions are written in Python — the language that lets me pretend I'm fast while actually relying on pure Christmas magic.

Find them here: `./2024/python/`

### **🦀 2025 — Rust**
All my 2025 solutions are written in Rust — because nothing screams “holiday spirit” like the borrow checker gently yelling at you.

Find them here: `./2025/rust/`
